# Grain Themes

A Grain website project is called a _theme_. Themes define the website structure, appearance, and content arrangement.

Typically, a Grain theme ships with:

- The website and Grain configuration
- HTML templates called *layouts*
- Stylesheets, JavaScript files, and images
- Code sources to process website pages (for instance, to implement pagination)
- Samples of raw content files

## Available Grain themes

Grain has a few already developed themes with responsive layouts. To use any of them, you can follow to the GitHub
repository of a particular theme, download it, and run the project with the `./grainw` command.

It's not required to know Groovy or any other programming language for the Java platform to use these available Grain
themes. You can easily manage the website content and configure your project as you need.
